## Usage
### Video Tutorials
For people who prefer watching a video to understand how the MCA Selector works, there is a very nice tutorial on Youtube explaining the basics:

* [How To Clear Unwanted Chunks In Minecraft 1.16 | MCASelector Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADDTXGRJo20) by [Muriako](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpt-MjKkc5X4W7bUFV3Dwrw)
* [Preparing Your World for the Nether Update! - The Minecraft Survival Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fiyVvoD9jQ) starting at [2:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fiyVvoD9jQ&t=2m52s) by [Pixlriffs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgGjBqZZtAjxfpGSba7d6ww)
* [How To Reset The End Dimension! - The Minecraft Survival Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-2gFkJl_Lo) starting at [8:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-2gFkJl_Lo&t=8m45s) by [Pixlriffs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgGjBqZZtAjxfpGSba7d6ww)

### Navigation
Executing the tool, it shows an empty window with a chunk and a region grid. To actually show a world, open a folder containing Minecraft Anvil (\*.mca) files. The tool will then render a top-down view of this world that you can zoom into and zoom out of by scrolling up and down and that you can move around using the middle mouse button (`Cmd+LMB` on Mac OS) or using `WASD`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Querz/5e08c4ab863c2ad8b5da146dc4188ecb/raw/306b90aa139a9c029705570393178266d7117b6b/default.png" alt="MCA Selector window showing chunk and region grid">
</p>

Zooming out far enough disables the selection of single chunks but lets you select entire regions.

### Selections
Upon finishing selecting chunks and regions, they can be deleted or exported using the `Selection`-menu. Exported chunks and regions are not deleted from the original world.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Querz/5e08c4ab863c2ad8b5da146dc4188ecb/raw/f17333764e8b3ab281c707587db7c73b23b589b1/selections.png" alt="MCA Selector window showing chunk and region selection export">
</p>

A selection (not the chunks and regions themselves) can also be exported or imported and even be applied to different worlds.

### Chunk filter
The MCA Selector also contains a powerful tool to delete or export chunks and regions by conditions like the data version, the time it was last updated, how much time players have spent in this chunk and some more. Multiple of these conditions can be used to create a very specific query describing what chunks and regions should be deleted or exported.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Querz/5e08c4ab863c2ad8b5da146dc4188ecb/raw/306b90aa139a9c029705570393178266d7117b6b/filter_chunks.png" alt="MCA Selector window showing the chunk filter">
</p>

Because the conditions use internal values used by Minecraft, the following table gives a brief explanation on what they do:

| Condition | Type | Description |
| --------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Group | - | Groups multiple conditions. |
| DataVersion | int | The DataVersion tag of the chunk. 100-1343 for 1.12.2 and below, 1444 for 1.13 snapshots and above. |
| InhabitedTime | long | The total amount of time in game-ticks players have spent in that chunk. 1 second ~20 ticks. Also accepts a duration string such as `1 year 2 months 3 days 4 hours 5 minutes 6 seconds`. |
| LastUpdate | int | The time a chunk was last updated in seconds since 1970-01-01. Also accepts a timestamp in the `yyyy-MM-dd HH-mm-ss`-format such as `2018-01-02 15:03:04`. If the time is omitted, it will default to `00:00:00`. |
| xPos | int | The location of the chunk on the x-axis in chunk coordinates. |
| zPos | int | The location of the chunk on the z-axis in chunk coordinates. |
| Palette | String | A list of comma (,) separated 1.13 block names. The block names will be converted to block ids for chunks with DataVersion 1343 or below. The validation of block names can be skipped by writing them in single quotes ('). Example: `sand,'new_block',gravel`.|
| Status | String | The status of the chunk generation. Only recognized by Minecraft 1.13+ (DataVersion 1444+) |
| LightPopulated | byte | Whether the light levels for the chunk have been calculated. If this is set to 0, converting a world from 1.12.x to 1.13 will omit that chunk. Allowed values are `0` and `1`. |
| Biome | String/int | One or multiple biome names and IDs, separated by comma (,). For a reference of biome names and IDs, have a look at the [Wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Java_Edition_data_values#Biomes). Custom biomes can be specified by using single quotes (') around a biome ID. |
| Entities | String | One or multiple entity names, separated by comma (,). For a reference of entity names, have a look at the [Wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Java_Edition_data_values#Entities). Custom entities are supported, though they must be declared in single quotes (') and with their namespace id. |
| #Entities | int | The total amount of entities in that chunk. |
| #TileEntities | int | The total amount of tile entities in that chunk. |

Fields that allow multiple comma separated values act the same as multiple consecutive filters of the same type with single values connected with the `AND` operator.

A string representation of the query is printed in a text field below the query editor. When entering a query into this field directly, press `Enter` to parse it into the query editor.

**Notice**
Running the query will check the `.mca`-file's name first if the query would even apply to any chunk in this file using the xPos and zPos conditions, as long as the query is built in a way that allows doing this.

### NBT Changer
The NBT Changer modifies the world files directly by changing specific values.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Querz/5e08c4ab863c2ad8b5da146dc4188ecb/raw/306b90aa139a9c029705570393178266d7117b6b/change_nbt.png" alt="MCA Selector window showing the nbt changer">
</p>

You can change the following values:

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| LightPopulated | byte | Whether the light levels for the chunk have been calculated. If this is set to `0`, converting a world from 1.12.x to 1.13 will omit that chunk. Allowed values are `0` and `1` |
| DataVersion | int | Allows to change the DataVersion of the chunks. Should be used with extreme care. |
| InhabitedTime | long | This field stores the amount of game-ticks players have spent in a chunk. Impacts the local difficulty. |
| LastUpdate | long | Stores a timestamp when this chunk was last updated in Milliseconds. |
| Status | String | The status of the chunk generation. Only recognized by Minecraft 1.13+ (DataVersion 1444+) |
| Biome | String/int | A biome name or ID. This sets all biomes of this chunk to a single biome. For a reference of biome names and IDs, have a look at the [Wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Java_Edition_data_values#Biomes). Custom biomes can be specified by using single quotes (') around a biome ID. |
| DeleteEntities | boolean | If set to `1` or `true`, all entities in that chunk will be deleted. |
| DeleteSections | boolean | One or a range of section indices. A range has the format `<from>:<to>`, inclusive. Omitting `<from>` sets the lowest possible value, omitting `<to>` sets the highest possible value. `:` or `true` means _all_ sections. Multiple ranges or single indices can be defined by separating them with a comma. |

Once the field is highlighted in green, the value is considered valid and will be changed. A gray field, no matter its content, will be ignored.

For more information about the fields have a look at the chunk format description on [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Chunk_format)

### Chunk Editor
When selecting a single chunk, the menu "Edit chunks" becomes available. It allows precise editing of the entire NBT structure of that chunk. Names and values can be changed, added, deleted or moved (drag & drop).

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Querz/5e08c4ab863c2ad8b5da146dc4188ecb/raw/306b90aa139a9c029705570393178266d7117b6b/edit_chunk.png" alt="MCA Selector window showing the NBT editor">
</p>

**Notice** When the NBT editor does not show any data, the cached top-down view might be outdated, and the chunk might not exist anymore in the mca files. In that case, clearing the cache will re-render the regions from scratch and show the up-to-date top-down view.

### Chunk import
Importing chunks can be easily done by opening the target world first using `File --> Open` and then merging the chunks of a second world using `Tools --> Import chunks`. After selecting a folder containing region files, it is possible to import the chunks with a bunch of additional options.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Querz/5e08c4ab863c2ad8b5da146dc4188ecb/raw/306b90aa139a9c029705570393178266d7117b6b/import_chunks.png" alt="MCA Selector window showing the chunk import">
</p>

Options:
* **Offset** imports chunks with an offset in chunk coordinates. To convert block coordinates to chunk coordinates, divide them by 16.
* **Overwrite existing chunks** deletes existing chunks and overwrites them with the imported ones.
* **Apply to selection only** imports chunks into the current selection.
* **Sections** defines one, or a range of sections to be imported. A range has the format `<from>:<to>`, inclusive. Omitting `<from>` sets the lowest possible value, omitting `<to>` sets the highest possible value. `:`, `true` or empty means _all_ sections. Multiple ranges or single indices can be defined by separating them with a comma. If a chunk does not already exist at the location, it will be created containing only the specified sections of the imported chunk.

**Notice**
Commands inside of command blocks will not be changed.
Maps will not be updated, because their data is not stored inside region files.

### Copy and Paste
It is possible to copy a selection to the system clipboard and pasting it to a different location in the same world or into an entirely different world.
After making a selection, use `Selection --> Copy chunks` or press `Ctrl+C` (`Cmd+C` on Mac). After navigating to the location in the world where the copied chunks need to be pasted, use `Selection --> Paste chunks` or press `Ctrl+V` (`Cmd+V`on Mac) to display an overlay showing where the clipboard will be imported to. The overlay can be moved around by pressing and holding the left mouse button. Press `Ctrl+V` again to import the chunks at the selected location. This will open the [Import chunks](#chunk-import) dialog with prefilled values depending on where the overlay has been placed.
Copying can be cancelled by pressing `Esc`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Querz/5e08c4ab863c2ad8b5da146dc4188ecb/raw/f17333764e8b3ab281c707587db7c73b23b589b1/copy_paste.png" alt="MCA Selector window showing copy-paste overlay">
</p>

### Swapping chunks
When exactly two chunks are selected, they can be swapped using `Tools --> Swap chunks`. This is useful for corrupted region files when Minecraft failed to correctly save the region file index, resulting in scrambled chunks.

### Caching
The tool creates an image for each region from the provided mca-files. These images are saved separately inside a `cache`-folder in the working directory of the program for future usage. Experience showed that a Minecraft world with a size of 10GB resulted in cached image files with a total size of 80-100MB. Caching as many regions as possible significantly improves loading times though.

### Debugging
If something is not working properly or if you want to see the exact query that is run using the chunk filter, debugging can be enabled in the settings. It will print useful information about what the program is currently doing to the console.

## Supported Versions
The MCA Selector currently supports the following Minecraft versions:

| Minecraft Version | DataVersion |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| 1.2.1 - 1.12.2    | None - 1343 |
| 1.13 - 1.13.2     | 1444 - 1631 |
| 1.14 - 1.14.4     | 1901 - 1976 |
| 1.15 - 1.15.2     | 2200 - 2230 |
| 1.16-rc1 - ?      | 2564 - ?    |

There is no guarantee for worlds generated in a Snapshot version to work, even if it is specified in the table above. This only represents the current development status towards the next Minecraft release. Old Snapshots of past Minecraft releases are not supported.

### Filter query

A filter query is a text representation of the chunk filter that can be created in the UI of the program. It is shown in the text field below the query editor of the Chunk filter tool.
Example:
```
--query "xPos >= 10 AND xPos <= 20 AND Palette contains \"sand,water\""
```
This will select all chunks that contain sand and water blocks and their x-position ranges from 10 to 20.
As shown, double quotes (") must be escaped with a backslash, in a way specificed by your command-line shell.

Groups are represented with a pair of parentheses (`(...)`). As with the chunk filter, logical operators are evaluated from left to right, and `AND` has a higher precedence than `OR`. In other words, `a AND b OR c AND d AND e` is the same as `(a AND b) OR (c AND d AND e)`. It differs from `c AND d AND e OR a AND b` not by the result, but by the sequence of tests performed due to [short-circuiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation).

### Change values

The query for changing NBT values in chunks looks slightly different to the filter query. It is a comma (,) separated list of assignments.
Example:
```
--query "LightPopulated = 1, Status = empty"
```
This will set the field "LightPopulated" to "1" and "Status" to "empty". Just like the filter query, the query to change values is printed to the console when using the UI in debug mode.

## Download and installation

[**Download Version 1.12**](https://github.com/Querz/mcaselector/releases/download/1.12/mcaselector-1.12.jar)

"Requirements":
* Either:
  * 64bit JRE 8+, you can get it from [HERE](https://www.java.com/en/download/windows-64bit.jsp)
  * A Minecraft Java Edition installation
* A computer
  * At least 6 GB of RAM. If lower, more RAM has to manually be assigned to the JVM using the `-Xmx` argument. Assigning 4 GB is recommended.
* A brain

#### If you have Java from Oracle installed on your system

Most likely, `.jar` files are associated with java on your computer, it should therefore launch by simply double clicking the file (or however your OS is configured to open files using your mouse or keyboard). If not, you can try `java -jar mcaselector-1.12.jar` from your console. If this doesn't work, you might want to look into how to modify the `PATH` variable on your system to tell your system that java is an executable program.

#### If you have Minecraft Java Edition installed on your system

Minecraft Java Edition comes with a JRE that you can use to start the MCA Selector, so there is no need to install another version of java on your system. On Windows, that java version is usually located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Minecraft\runtime\jre-x64\bin\` and once inside this folder you can simply run `java.exe -jar <path-to-mcaselector-1.12.jar>`. On Mac OS you should find it in `~/Library/Application\ Support/minecraft/runtime/jre-x64/jre.bundle/Contents/Home/bin/` where you can execute `./java -jar <path-to-mcaselector-1.12.jar>`.

**WARNING:** For macOS 10.14+ (Mojave) It is NOT recommended to use the JRE provided by Minecraft (1.8.0_74), because it contains a severe bug that causes JavaFX applications to crash when they lose focus while a dialog window (such as the save-file-dialog) is open (see the bug report [here](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8211304)). This bug has been fixed in Java 1.8.0_201 and above.

#### If you are using OpenJDK

If you are using a distribution of OpenJDK, you have to make sure that it comes with [JavaFX](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/), as it is needed to run the MCA Selector. Some distributions like AdoptOpenJDK (shipped with most Linux distributions) do not ship with JavaFX by default. On Debian distributions, an open version of JavaFX is contained in the `openjfx` package. This or some other installation of JavaFX is required to run the `.jar`.

#### If you are using Java 11 or higher

If you are using Java 11 or higher, the JavaFX modules are not included automatically. You will need to include them by specifying the module path for JavaFX. Some examples are included below, but you may need to edit paths if your system stores the JavaFX modules in a different location.

On Windows with Oracle Java 13:
```
"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-13.0.1\bin\java.exe" --module-path "C:\Program Files\Java\javafx-sdk-13.0.1\lib" --add-modules ALL-MODULE-PATH -jar mcaselector-1.12.jar
```

On Debian with OpenJDK 11 and openjfx:
```
java --module-path /usr/share/openjfx/lib --add-modules ALL-MODULE-PATH -jar mcaselector-1.12.jar
```

##
If none of these instructions work, apply "A brain" that you providently held ready after having read the "Requirements" section carefully.
